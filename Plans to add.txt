TOP PRIORITY BEFORE WEBSITE LAUNCH:

1: (on hold until website launch) Change form to send to the proper email (jv@speedpackexpress.com)
2: (on hold) Create capatcha security system for the contact page (cant do until website is launched)
4. Create a references page that can be accessed in the support page.

OTHER EDITS THAT CAN BE FIXED AFTER LAUNCH:

1: Change hyperlinks to blue or another color that contrasts grey
4: in services page, white background blocks out words in the "other section" so change the picture or edit text 
color
5: in services, change image of the special vehicles truck. does not match the asthetic of the page

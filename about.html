                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Speedpack Express, Inc. was founded in 2000 by logistics professionals with over 25 years 
                    in the industry. We started out by providing ground transportation in Miami and 
                    Ft. Lauderdale for courier companies and freight forwarders across the nation, growing 
                    steadily through trial and error—arguably the best teachers. Over a decade later, almost
                     exclusively through word of mouth, Speedpack Express grew into the pickup and delivery 
                     agent of choice in South Florida. Throughout this time, our underlying principles were,
                      and still remain: keep service levels high and costs fair.</p>
